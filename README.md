# Project Documentation Guide

Welcome to the project! This repository contains both the backend and frontend parts of the application. To keep the documentation organized and detailed, the instructions and usage guides are split into their respective folders.

## Where to Find Documentation

- **Backend Documentation**  
  Please refer to the [`backend/README.md`](./backend/README.md) file for all instructions related to backend setup, API endpoints, environment configuration, and other backend-specific information.

- **Frontend Documentation**  
  Please refer to the [`frontend/README.md`](./frontend/README.md) file for instructions on how to install, run, and build the frontend application, as well as UI-related guidelines and development notes.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, we recommend first reading the backend documentation to understand the API and server setup, then the frontend documentation to learn how to interact with the backend and run the user interface.

## Contact

For any questions or issues, please open an issue in this repository or contact the maintainers directly.
