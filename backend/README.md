## FYI 
- For this project we are used prisma and Express Js structure to combination build REST + MVC API sercvice
- First i set the configuration for eslint to be good structure in my program
- Dont forget to build structure to be good
- And then i testing my controller to unit testing and api to be integration testing for this
- I get the coverage to see the presentace for good or not , i launch my testing
  
## Getting Started
